Philosophy – Page 1

Philosophy is the study of fundamental questions concerning existence,
knowledge, values, reason, and reality. It encourages critical thinking
and logical reasoning, helping individuals examine beliefs and
assumptions.

Major branches of philosophy include metaphysics, epistemology, ethics,
logic, and aesthetics. Eastern and Western philosophical traditions
offer diverse perspectives on life, self, and the universe.

Philosophy does not provide final answers but develops the ability to
ask meaningful questions. It influences science, politics, law, and
everyday decision-making.

Ethical philosophy examines concepts of right and wrong, justice, and
moral responsibility. By engaging with philosophy, individuals gain
clarity of thought and intellectual independence.

Philosophy remains relevant because it addresses timeless human concerns
and promotes rational inquiry.
