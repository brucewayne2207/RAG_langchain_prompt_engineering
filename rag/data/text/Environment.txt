The environment encompasses all living and non-living elements that
support life on Earth. It includes air, water, land, plants, animals,
and the complex interactions among them. Environmental balance is
essential for sustaining ecosystems and human civilization. Human
activities such as industrialization, deforestation, and pollution have
placed immense pressure on natural systems.

Climate change is one of the most pressing environmental challenges
today. Rising global temperatures, melting glaciers, and extreme weather
events are direct consequences of increased greenhouse gas emissions.
Sustainable development aims to meet present needs without compromising
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Conservation efforts focus on protecting biodiversity, reducing
pollution, and promoting renewable energy. Individual responsibility,
along with government policies and international cooperation, plays a
crucial role. Environmental education increases awareness and encourages
responsible behavior toward nature.

A healthy environment is not a luxury but a necessity. Economic growth
and environmental protection must go hand in hand to ensure long-term
survival and prosperity.
