Oceans cover more than seventy percent of the Earth’s surface and are
essential to life on the planet. They regulate climate, produce oxygen,
and support vast biodiversity.

Marine ecosystems include coral reefs, deep-sea environments, and
coastal regions. Oceans provide food, transportation routes, and
economic opportunities.

Pollution, overfishing, and climate change pose serious threats to ocean
health. Rising sea temperatures and acidification affect marine species
and ecosystems.

Conservation of oceans involves sustainable fishing, pollution control,
and protection of marine habitats. International cooperation is
necessary because oceans connect all nations.

Healthy oceans are vital for environmental balance and human survival.
