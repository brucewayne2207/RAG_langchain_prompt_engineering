1.Practical RAG & LangChain Learning

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, and Prompt Engineering.
It contains experiments, notes, and small implementations created while understanding how modern LLM-based systems are built.

2.What This Repository Covers

Fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs)

Prompt Engineering techniques

LangChain core concepts and components

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines

Vector databases and embeddings

Document loaders and text splitters

Chains, tools, and agents

End-to-end mini projects and experiments

3.Learning Goals

Understand how RAG improves LLM responses

Build modular LLM applications using LangChain

Learn effective prompt design patterns

Gain practical experience with embeddings and retrieval

Create reusable and explainable LLM pipelines


4.Tech Stack

Python

LangChain

OpenAI / compatible LLM APIs

Vector Databases (FAISS / Chroma)

Jupyter Notebooks

Git & GitHub
